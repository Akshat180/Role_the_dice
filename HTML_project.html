    <p>Also known by the names Hidimba Devi Temple and Dhungari Temple, this ancient shrine was built by Maharaja Bahadur Singh way back in 1553. As the name suggests, the temple is dedicated to Hidimba Devi, wife of Bheema. The wooden architecture of the shrine is very distinct from most Hindu temples you will come across in the country. There’s another shrine dedicated to Hidimba Devi’ son Ghatotkacha in the premises. Surrounded by thick cedar groves and with snow-capped mountains serving as the backdrop, the temple is one of the best places to visit in Manali.</p><br>

    <p>A mini valley located at about 8400 feet above sea level, Solang Nala is a short drive away from Manali. It is a haven for adventure and sports lovers and while here, you can try your skills on a pair of skis or go for a snowmobile exploration. When the weather warms up, people flock here for zorbing and paragliding. You can also hop onto a cable car and enjoy mesmerizing views of the Himalayas.

    <p>The rushing cascades of Jogini Falls are a short and invigorating trek away from the main town of Manali. The trail that leads to the waterfall is scenic and gives you a glimpse of the River Beas and the snow-capped peaks of Rohtang. Apart from the serene setting, Jogini is also an important place of pilgrimage and you can visit many old shrines around the pool at the bottom. An early start is recommended so that you can spend more time at this picturesque natural spot, which is one of the top trekking as well as picnic places in Manali.</p>
